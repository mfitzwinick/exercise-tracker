[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-overtime.svg)](https://forthebaadge.com)

## Purpose

This application can be used for someone who would like to create exercises and track the completion of their workouts.

## Functionality

On the front end, there are three html pages that track information. The dashboard displays the current date as well as exercise data. There are two options you can choose:

1. to CONTINUE your workout
   or
2. to CREATE a new workout

Depending up the path you chose, the user fills in inputs which are posted to a database, and retrieved to populate the dashboard.

## Languages and Specifications

This was created using the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- nmp Express modules
- Mongo DB with MONGOOSE installation
- Morgan is installed (used for developers to track routing)
